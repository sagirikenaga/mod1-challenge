# <Module 1 Challenge >

## Description

This project demonstrated the changes that were needed in order to optimize the HTML and CSS formatting so that it is ideal for accessibility standards, and also for search engine optimization. Comments were added to the stylesheet to explain the changes made and why these changes were implemented, so that future readers may understand the modifications. This project teaches the importance of organization within a code- it helps with collaboration, maintenance, searching lines within the code, and avoiding repeated, irrelevant codes. 


## Updates

-Changed div tags in the index and replaced with more meaningful elements such as <header>, <footer>, <section>
-Removed unnecessary content in stylesheet that had no effect on webpage
-Condensed different classes that contained the same properties into a single class
-Added alt text to images for search engine optimization
-Ensured all links were functional
